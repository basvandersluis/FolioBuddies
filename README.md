# FolioBuddies
PortfolioBuddy is a matching app for designers and developers so they can collaboratively work on their portfolios while supporting each other with their expertise. The project is 100% non-profit and if there is to be a financial component to this service it will be ad-based. The goal of the MVP is to find early-adopters and help them find a match for their portfolio-needs.
